    <p class="title">takeLast operator</p>
    <p>Waits for the source to complete, then emits the last N values from the source, as specified by the count
        argument.</p>
    <p>takeLast results in an observable that will hold values up to count values in memory, until the source completes.
    </p>
    <p>It then pushes all values in memory to the consumer, in the order they were received from the source, then
        notifies the consumer that it is complete.</p>
    <p>
        If for some reason the source completes before the count supplied to takeLast is reached, all values received
        until that point are emitted, and then completion is notified.
    </p>
    <p>Warning: Using takeLast with an observable that never completes will result in an observable that never emits a
        value.</p>
