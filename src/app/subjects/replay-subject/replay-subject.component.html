    <p class="title">Replay Subjects</p>

    <p>A ReplaySubject is similar to a BehaviorSubject in that it can send old values to new subscribers, 
        but it can also record a part of the Observable execution.</p>

    <p>When creating a ReplaySubject, you can specify how many values to replay.</p>
